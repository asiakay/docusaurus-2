[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.

Sabotage in the workplace can be a frustrating and stressful experience. It's hard enough to navigate office politics and meet deadlines without having to worry about someone deliberately trying to interfere with or damage your work or reputation. But what can you do if you suspect that a coworker is sabotaging your work?

The first step is to gather evidence. Document any instances of sabotage and any witness statements that support your claim. This will be important if you need to bring the issue to your manager or HR department.

Next, try to have a private conversation with the person you believe is sabotaging your work. Explain how their actions are affecting you and your work, and ask if there is a way to resolve the issue.

It's important to be open to feedback and willing to listen to their perspective as well. It is possible that the actions that seems like sabotage may not be intentional, and it may be a misscommunication or misunderstanding.

If talking to your coworker doesn't resolve the issue, bring it to the attention of your manager. Provide them with the evidence you have collected and ask for their help in resolving the situation. Be sure to follow your company's policies and procedures when addressing the issue, and if there is an employee handbook, reference it during the process.

It's also important to remember that sometimes, what appears to be sabotage may not be intentional, and can be a result of a miscommunication or misunderstanding. In that case, it can be helpful to take a step back and try to understand the other person's perspective.

It's also a good idea to seek the help of HR department or other professional resources in case you feel unsafe or uncomfortable handling the situation by your own.

In order to prevent sabotage, it's important to maintain a positive and professional attitude towards your coworkers. Try to build good relationships with your coworkers and be willing to help others when they need it. This will help create a positive work environment and make it less likely that someone will want to sabotage your work.

Sabotage can be a difficult issue to deal with, but by following these steps and working with your manager and other resources, you can address the problem and protect yourself and your work. Remember that you are not alone in this, and it's important to speak up and take action if you suspect that someone is sabotaging your work.
