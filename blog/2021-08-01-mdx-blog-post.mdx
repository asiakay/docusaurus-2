Happiness is a feeling that we all strive for, but what truly makes us happy in the long run? According to the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which has been ongoing for 85 years, the biggest determinant of genuine, long-term happiness is not wealth, accomplishment, or pleasure, but the relationships we form with the people in our lives.

The study, which began in 1938, has followed the lives of 724 men, tracking their physical and mental health, relationships, and overall wellbeing. The findings have consistently shown that it is the relationships we form with the people in our lives, in our workplaces, and in our communities that bring us the greatest happiness in the long run.

To help people start the new year off on a positive note, the New York Times worked with the leader of the Harvard study to create a 7-Day Happiness Challenge. The challenge is designed to help people improve their relationships and increase their overall happiness. Here are four steps from the challenge that resonated with me and that can be done in about 10 minutes any time of the day.

Step 1: Plan an 8-minute phone call with a friend. The eight-minute phone call plan solves two ongoing problems with conversations. The first is that most of us tend to think that in some unspecified future, we'll have a 'time surplus,' where we'll be able to connect with old friends. But chances are that "someday" when we think we'll have lots of time for our friends will never come. So we need to make time right now or risk drifting away from our friendships. The second is that, as Harvard research has shown, most conversations go on too long, often longer than either party would prefer. So to set an eight-minute limit ahead of time, guarantees that this won't happen. It also makes it easy for even a very busy friend to say yes to the call.

Step 2: Start a conversation with a stranger. Research has shown that starting a conversation with a stranger increases our happiness, even when we don't expect that it will. Given that humans are profoundly social creatures and that we all thrive on connection, that shouldn't really be as surprising as it is.

Step 3: Get to know someone at work. Work friends are incredibly important, particularly in the high pressure and long hours that go with starting a business. Yet, experts say, we don't always recognize the value of these relationships. So choose someone at work you would like to get to know better and make an effort to connect with them.

Step 4: Reach out to a family member. Many of us have family members that we haven't spoken to in a while. Reach out to one of them and let them know that you're thinking of them. This can be a phone call, email, or letter. The important thing is to make the effort to connect.

In conclusion, the Harvard Study of Adult Development has shown us that it is the relationships we form with the people in our lives that bring us the greatest happiness in the long run. By incorporating the steps from the 7-Day Happiness Challenge into our daily routine, we can improve our relationships and increase our overall happiness. So, make that 8-minute phone call, start a conversation with a stranger, get to know someone at work, and reach out to a family member. Your happiness will thank you for it.
